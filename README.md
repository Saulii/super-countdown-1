# Super countdown
A iteration based mini-project for beginner programmers to learn some frontend technologies

## Methodology
* Hands-on approach.
* Build the same thing again and again, every time adding a twist.
* Every iteration has constraints to make sure that a particular technology is exercised.

## Rules
* Use a GitHub repository (fork this one).
* Leave master as it is.
* Create a branch for each iteration with the following naming convention: `iteration-#`.
* Find a mentor (an experienced frontend developer).
* After finishing an iteration, push the changes to the iteration branch and ask your mentor for a review.

## Iterations
* [Iteration 0](./iteration-0.md) - Hello Date()
* [Iteration 1](./iteration-1.md) - Hello Clock!
* [Iteration 2](./iteration-2.md) - Clock - render()
* [Iteration 3](./iteration-3.md) - Clock - setTimeout()

# Iteration 0

* Create a file `index.html` and a script `index.js`.
* When the page is loaded, it should show the current time in the format `hours:minutes:seconds`. (e.g. 12:21:09)

## UI
* Background black.
* Text white.
* Responsive (should look fine in mobile and desktop devices).
* Use a nice font from google fonts.

## Constraints
* No 3rd party libraries are allowed.
* Use css only (no scss or sass allowed here).

## Hints
* Get the current date - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
* Use `document.querySelector` to find an HTML element. (See docs in MDN)
* Use `Node.textContent` to replace the text of an HTML element. (See docs in MDN)

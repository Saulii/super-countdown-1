# Iteration 3

* Based on previous iteration.
* **Twist:** Use a custom `render()` function to update the UI instead of the previous method.

## Constraints
* Use of `window.setInterval` is not allowed

## Hints
* Use `window.setTimeout` to register a callback that will be executed after a specified amount of milliseconds.
* The clock still has to be updated every second.

# Iteration 3

* Based on previous iteration.
* **Twist:** Use `window.setTimeout` instead of `window.setInterval`

## Constraints
* Use of `window.setInterval` is not allowed

## Hints
* Use `window.setTimeout` to register a callback that will be executed after a specified amount of milliseconds.
* The clock still has to be updated every second.
* Take some time to learn about `recursion`. You'll need it to complete this iteration.

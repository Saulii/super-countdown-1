# Iteration 4

* Based on previous iteration.
* **Twist:** Use a `Promise` around of instead of `window.setTimeout`

## Constraints
* Use of `window.setInterval` is not allowed

## Hints
* Use `window.setTimeout` to register a callback that will be executed after a specified amount of milliseconds.
* The clock still has to be updated every second.
